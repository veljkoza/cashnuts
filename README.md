Folder | Description
------ | -----------
`_gulp` | Gulp & Webpack tasks
`dist/` | Production code (autogenerated)
`serve/` | Browsersync serving folder (autogenerated)
`src/` | Development sources
`src/embedded` | Image sources that are manually inserted right into HTML or CSS code
`src/sprites` | SVG icons that are generated into `sprites.svg` by Gulp


## Development

At first, you need `npm` (or `yarn`) and `gulp-cli` to be installed globally. 

1. Install development dependencies, run:

   `yarn` or `npm install`

2. Start the development mode (Browsersync will serve files from the `src` folder), run:

   `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

3. Edit files in the `src` folder, and watch the results in your browser.

   P.S. If your browser doesn't automatically open a new tab, type in `localhost:3000` in your browser's address
    bar.


## Production

1. To build the sources (Gulp will generate production-ready code into the `dist` folder), run:

   `yarn build` or `npm run build`
